	<div class="link-title blue-bg">Overview</div>
		<div class="title">
		<ol>
			<li><p>There will be two divisions.  Division I is for algorithmically strong contestants.  The Division I (D1)problem set will be a lite version of the problems you might see at Pacific NW Regionals and/or World Finals.  Division II (D2) is approachable for contestants that have not completed the algorithm sequence at their school and/or have not competed in programming contests before. Almost all problems in D2 will be at the CS1 and CS2 levels.  Most contestants in this division have a great chance at solving many problems.  If a contestant does well in this division this year, that team should try D1 next year!  Participating in D2 will not count against your eligibility for Pacific NW Regionals or World Finals in future years (other than the rules established by ICPC itself based on age/year in school -- the the Contest Rules tab above for more information on the ICPC rules).  Please see the following FAQ for more details on the two divisions: <a href="http://www.acmicpc-pacnw.org/TwoDivisionsFAQ.htm" target="_blank">Two Divisions FAQ</a></p></li>
			<li><p>At least 8 problems will be posed.</p></li>
			<li><p>Problems will be posed in English. During the contest, all communications with contest officials must be in English. Contestants may bring electronic natural language translators that do not support math operations.</p></li>
			<li><p>Contestants may not bring their own computers, computer terminals, keyboards, PDAs, cell phones, MP3 players, CD players, calculators or any other electronic device or media.</p></li>
			<li><p>Contestants may bring any human readable material, including books, manuals and printed code. (Contestants may NOT share these resources.)</p></li>

		<div class="title">
			<ol>
				<li>You may NOT pre-enter any code during practice contest! This is grounds for expulsion</li>

				<li>Frivolous submissions and clarifications (especially during the practice contest) are counter to the spirit of the contest and can result in disqualification. Frivolous submissions include, but are not limited to, “testing” the judges on things such as white-space, formatting, etc.
				YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</li>

				<li>Items you can and cannot bring into the contest area (which includes any study areas and rest rooms):
				<ul>
				<li>YES – books *</li>

				<li>NO laptops, NO PDAs, NO cell phones</li>
				<li>NO headphones/CD Players/MP3 players</li>

				*You may NOT share these resources!!
				</ul>
				</li>

				<li>During the contest, speak only to the contest staff.
				<ul>
				<li>If you have a question about a problem statement, use the clarification tool in PC^2.</li>
				<li>If you have hardware/software issues, speak directly to a staff member.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

				<li>You may not leave the contest area except to use the restroom. (Escorts will be provided to take contestants to/from the restroom.)</li>

				<li>Only the allowed contest languages (C/C++, Python and Java) may be used to solve problems. You are not allowed to utilize system calls to any other languages, such as, but not limited to, perl and python (unless using python of course).</li>

				<li>Any attempt to access the Internet (including ftp, email, web or any other remote access) from a contest machine will result in immediate disqualification from the contest.</li>

				<li>Any attempt to access another contest machine, either physically or over the network, will result in immediate disqualification from the contest.</li>

				<li>Any other behavior, deemed by a contest official to be dishonest, disruptive or otherwise not keeping with the spirit of the contest will also result in a sanction appropriate to the offense.</li>

	<div class="link-title blue-bg">Scoring</div>
		<div class="title">
		<p>Contestants are ranked according to the most problems solved. Contestants who solve the same number of problems are ranked first by least total time and, if need be, by the earliest time of submittal of the last accepted run.</p>
		<p>The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.</p>
